	  I have spent many, many hours on 'Escape To Cat City' and after being played through successfully a few times the game is now broken. Attempts have been made to restore it's functionality, but I have been unsuccessful. I leave you with the broken game, stills from each room, and a playable tester from in class. <br> The 'red room' sprite started taking an item instead of giving you a key, so I have immortalised the beginning of the end with this gif.<br><br> <img src="img/glitterfyKNUCKLES.gif" width="250" height="250" alt=""/><br><br><br>
